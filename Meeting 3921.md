### Agenda

-   Q/A about transition from old to new board (10 mins)
-   
-   - Old Board expectations
    

-   Is there a timeline for the board to transition? 
    

-   We set the original timeline for feb to get folks to reach out to us, and now that we’re here, we are going to start with the next steps (i.e. lawyer, bank, google accounts, relationship transitioning) 
    
-   We (current board) will close out 2020 taxes, will loop in future board to be privy to the process
    
-   Overall timeline may be 3-6 months (allow buffer for communication/etc)
    

-   How/when will we communicate this transition decision to the chapter organizers (aka internal) and the community (aka external)
    

-   Will check in with Old board about their opinions about the communication, Will be owned by New board
    

-   According to bylaws, old president has voting rights, what is your stance on that position
    

-   happy to decline the voting seat if it helps the current board, we have the freedom to do what we want.
    

-   - Jessica’s W/S/C Administrative Status
    

-   What happened with Jessica’s employment?
    

-   Jessica had a short term contract (12 weeks, 20hrs a week) to do administrative work. 
    
-   Contract ended up getting extended because there was still administrative work to do like accounting.
    
-   Volume of work has since decreased. 
    
-   Nov/Dec Old board made decision to step back and Jessica offered to find volunteers for a new board
    
-   Old board wanted to transition new board in with the opportunity to choose what kind of paid staff they wanted. Old board communicated to Jessica that they wanted to finish the original work described. 
    

-   New shift in understanding of what it means to be a part of the new board now that Jessica is not taking care of the administrative work. How does everyone else feel about that?
    

-   What tools do we have to go forward with the administrative tasks that Jessica took care of?
    

-   We’ll create email accounts and internal docs
    
-   We’ll make introductions to people like the lawyer and accountant
    
-   We pay for services to help manage WSC
    

-   Marie wants to know what timeline are we expecting for transitioning and communicating with the lawyer.
    

-   The new board will take time to think and chat on Slack and get back to the old board
    

-   - Address healing and past experience emotions
    

-   Open discussion (20 mins)
    

-   - It’s been a few weeks. What are your new feelings about moving WSC forward by being part of this board?
    
-   - What narratives do you want to discuss to help bring closure to past experiences with the previous board?
