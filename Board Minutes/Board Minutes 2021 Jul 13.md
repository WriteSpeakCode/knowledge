-   Re: transparent board meetings
    

-   Maybe start with closed meeting and publish notes in Slack
    
-   Every month have a town hall where WSC attendees can ask questions about the notes and decisions the board made
    

-   Discuss next steps, what will take to get there?
    
-   Combine with blog idea
    
-   Create a template for what this post would look like
    
-   Maybe it always ends with a reflections section
    

-   To think about: start a blog to document our meetings, decisions, values, etc
    

-   Have a rotating writer so people can get a feel for each board member’s personality and to share responsibility
    

-   To discuss more: a Write/Speak/Code magazine for articles that are written/created from WSC events
    

-   Chicago had plans to create something like this on [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
    
-   [https://dev.to/wsc](https://dev.to/wsc)
    

-   https://dev.to/organization-info
    

Idea for the blog is:

-   Highlighting Blog Posts from members
    
-   Letting members write directly to the blog***
    
-   Highlighting events members will speak at
    
-   Highlighting WSC events
    
-   Highlighting members and member accomplishments
    

*** Depending on how permissions shake out

Kind of like a newsletter but also with posts.

Hey Susana, Thanks for asking the question!  
Write/Speak/Code is intentional about creating an inclusive experience

for our community, as well providing diversity in the perspectives we share.

At our conference, in our chapter events, and in our leadership, we aim to feature 50% people of color with a focus on featuring Black and Latinx speakers and 25% LGBTQIA+ speakers, as well as create proportional representation in our audience. 

  
Regarding the current makeup of the board, we’re each going to post our identities in this thread. We know it doesn't make the above mark, but we’re committed to getting there, not just in our racial makeup, but also in gender diversity.

  
As a team, one of the values we believe in is dismantling white supremacy in our actions, and I believe part of doing that is being active in our aim to have more BIPOC, and gender diverse board members and organization leadership. (i.e. chapter leaders, etc)  
  
One way to start getting involved is via participation in our monthly Board town halls which will be coming up on the first Tuesday of each month for folks to communicate with us about what they’d like to see the organization take on, and discuss what we’ve been doing as board members for the past month.  
  
We’re just getting started as a board, but if folks are interested, or know someone who is, please reach out, or join us next month in our Town Hall conversation!
