Prioritized items that are carried over from last meeting

1.  Website update about board transition, sponsors, etc
    

1.  Kara has been working with Nicola to update the website
    
2.  Working on branches that will have profiles of ppl like board members, create a blog content, etc
    
3.  After those branches merge, then we make sure board members have admin permissions thru Netlify
    

3.  Transparent board meetings: plan town hall (and maybe discuss blog post)
    

1.  Red will spearhead organizing the townhall
    

1.  Next steps:
    

1.  Look through the notes really quick to make sure nothing too egregious is in the Board meeting notes.
    
2.  Make board meeting notes available. Maybe add them to a Slack channel and that’s the channel where ppl submit questions for the townhall.
    
3.  Then, schedule a townhall via Meetup
    
4.  Townhall will have a Zoom link, but limited permissions. Only board members speak.
